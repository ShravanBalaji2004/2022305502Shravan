These sequences are derived from bacteriophage DNA fragments from previous infections and are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages in subsequent infections, providing a form of acquired immunity.

Cas9 uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cut specific DNA strands, enabling gene editing within living organisms. This technology has broad applications, including basic biological research, biotech product development, and disease treatment.  The development of CRISPR-Cas9 was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. \n",

These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that have previously infected the prokaryote.  CRISPR sequences are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence, CRISPRs are a key part of a prokaryotic adaptive immune system.  Cas genes (CRISPR-associated genes) work with CRISPR sequences, encoding enzymes that cut DNA and play other roles in this defense.  The CRISPR-Cas system has been adapted by scientists to edit genomes, making it a revolutionary tool in genetic engineering. \n",
