            "**Overall Strengths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Strong academic performance highlighted effectively.\n",
            "* Good list of laboratory skills categorized appropriately.\n",
            "*  Evidence of leadership and extracurricular involvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall Weaknesses:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Lack of quantifiable achievements and impact.  The resume lists skills and activities but doesn't explain how these skills were applied or what results were achieved.\n",
            "* Inconsistent formatting and organization making it difficult to read.\n",
            "*  \"About Me\" section is too generic and lacks a clear career objective or summary.\n",
            "* Workshops section is too detailed and some entries seem less relevant.  Focus should be on experiences demonstrating key skills and career interests.\n",
            "*  Some extracurricular activities (quiz wins from years ago) are less relevant for a current career focus and should be removed or condensed.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Formatting and Content:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Use a consistent and professional font:** Stick to one or two easily readable fonts like Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman.\n",
            "* **Improve spacing and margins:** Use consistent spacing between sections and headings.  Ensure adequate white space for readability.\n",
            "* **Use bullet points effectively:**  Break down long paragraphs, especially in the \"About Me\" and skills sections.\n",
            "* **Reverse chronological order:**  List experiences within each section (Education, Experience, etc.) starting with the most recent.\n",
            "* **Quantify achievements:** Use numbers and metrics to demonstrate impact wherever possible (e.g., \"Increased cell viability by 15% through optimized staining techniques\").\n",
            "* **Create a distinct \"Experience\" section:**  Even without formal work experience, you can include research projects, volunteer work, or relevant academic projects here.  Describe your role, responsibilities, and outcomes.\n",
            "* **Tailor the resume:**  Adapt the resume to each specific job application, highlighting the skills and experiences most relevant to the target role.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Specific Areas to Add/Remove:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Add a clear career objective or summary:** Replace the \"About Me\" section with a concise statement outlining your career goals and highlighting your key skills.\n",
            "* **Add a \"Projects\" or \"Experience\" section:**  Detail any research projects, coursework projects, or other relevant experiences.\n",
            "* **Remove less relevant extracurriculars:**  The quiz wins from 2018 are less impactful now.  Focus on more recent and relevant activities.\n",
            "* **Condense the workshops section:**  Keep only the most relevant and impactful workshops, perhaps combining some into a single entry.\n",
            "* **Add a \"Software Skills\" section if applicable:** List any relevant software proficiency (e.g., statistical software, image analysis tools).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tone, Clarity, and Grammar:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Stronger action verbs:**  Begin bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., \"Conducted,\" \"Developed,\" \"Analyzed,\" \"Managed\").\n",
            "* **More concise language:**  Avoid overly wordy phrases.  Be direct and specific.\n",
            "* **Proofread carefully:** Eliminate any grammatical errors or typos.\n",
            "\n",
            "**ATS Friendliness Score:** 6/10\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Improve keyword optimization:**  Incorporate relevant keywords from job descriptions throughout the resume.\n",
            "* **Use standard headings:**  ATS systems may struggle with unusual headings.  Use standard section headings like \"Education,\" \"Experience,\" \"Skills,\" etc.\n",
            "* **Save as a PDF:** PDF format is generally the most ATS-friendly.\n",
            "* **Avoid tables or images:**  These can confuse ATS software.\n",

            "\n",
